Games using sensors

The application consists of two games using sensors. 
To play, you must enter your nickname, which is later saved along with the result to the sqlite database.

The first game (level 1):
It's about getting through the maze with obstacles, getting two bananas and getting into the hole. 
Touching an obstacle or hitting a hole with all the bananas causes the game to end. 
After starting this level, the time begins to count, so the goal of the game is to gather the bananas
as quickly as possible and hit the hole. The top 10 results are displayed in the lederboard.

The second game (level 2):
In this game, you can move the bitmap with the help of sensors only in the x-plane. 
After switching on the game, obstacles are generated that move towards our bitmap and there are gaps between the obstacles. 
Passing through each gaps gives us one point. Every ten obstacles, the speed of their movement increases. 
If we touch the obstacle the game ends. The top 10 results are saved to the lederboard.
